# CSCI 466 PA3 - Networked Client Server

## Instructions


Complete the following assignment individually.
Submit your work on D2L into the "Programming Assignment 3" folder. 


## Learning Objectives

In this programming assignment you will:

- Implement a Socket class for networked communications and Google Mock testing
- Modify your Client and Server implementations to transmit shots and results over the network, rather than through
 files on disk
- Alternate the processing of shots from each player using threads and semaphores


## Overview


Your objective is to extend your implementation of the 
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)) 
to transmit shot and result messages over the network.
To do so you will implement the `Socket` class that wraps TCP sockets into objects that send data, check if data on
 the socket is available, and receive data.
The advantage of using a separate `Socket` class is that we can also mock it in `tests.cpp`.

To complete this assignment you will extend your current implementation of Battleship.
You will extend your `Client` and `Server` classes to use your implementation of sockets.
I have also provided you with an updated `client_main.cpp` and `server_main.cpp` that uses the new socket class and
 also controls the processing of shots from the players using threads and semaphores.
The `server_main.cpp` sets up two semaphores and runs two `run_server` threads to process shots from each player.
You should modify the `Server.process_shot` function such that the two `run_server` threads alternate the processing of
 shots from each player.
 
I have also modified the tests to used the Google Mock framework, which allows the testing of functions without
 actually opening TCP sockets.


## Program Invocation

To play Battleship you should first start the server by running the `run-server` executable.
Then start the player clients by running two instances of the `run-client` executable.
Unfortunately, the client and server executables will not do anything interesting until you implement `Client.cpp` 
and `Server.cpp`.
As you progress in these implementations, your code will pass more and more tests in `tests.cpp`.
When your code passes all the tests, you will be able to run the client and server executables to play the game.


## What to Submit

Submit your work on D2L into the "Programming Assignment 3" folder. 

* A text file containing a link to a GitHub repository with your solution for the base assignment.
Please not that your repository should be private, so that other students cannot see your solutions.
You can create an unlimited number of private repositories by upgrading your github account to the pro version for
 free using the [academic discount](https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) with your school email.
In order for us to be able to see your solution, please add github users `cooperstrahan` and `mwittie` as
 collaborators through repository settings.
 
* A link to a YouTube video showing that your program forces the players to take alternate shots. In other words, the
 same client should not be able to make two shots in a row.


## Grading 

We will grade your submissions based on how many test cases in `tests.cpp` your solution passes.
You will also receive points based on whether your program forces the players to take alternating shots.

As in PA2, you have the opportunity to get working the tests that didn't work in the previous assignments to earn
 credit for those.
